Background Publishing Technical Reference
#########################################

Overview
********

tk-multi-bg-publish is a customizable Toolkit App that allows artists to perform ShotGrid publishes in a background process on their workstation so that they can move on to the next Task within their DCC.

.. important::
    This app is meant to allow for two things to happen at once on a single workstation, it is not intended to be an all-encompassing solution for queue management.

.. important::
    You will probably use twice as many resources on your workstation! RAM and CPU core usage may introduce performance issues while publishes are being performed in the background on your system.
