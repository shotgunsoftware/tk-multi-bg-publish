    #TODO: Need to remove the Open Log Folder comment in page above
    #TODO: See TODO comments in index.rst file

The logs are created in a different location than other ShotGrid Desktop Logs and they will not be deleted by default, you can find them here:

``$SHOTGRID_HOME/<site name>/<config folder>/tm-bg-publish/<engine name>``

You can use the interface to clean them up or delete using your OS' file browser capabilities.
